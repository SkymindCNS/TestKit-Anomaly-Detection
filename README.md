# CNN--Autoencoder

## Method Overview
- An autoencoder learning on training data is assumed to produce higher reconstruction error for the anomalous samples than the
normal samples and thus can distinguish anomalies from normal data.
- Reconstruction error is used as anomaly score (threshold set at 0.002). Anomaly score > 0.002 will classified as invalid
